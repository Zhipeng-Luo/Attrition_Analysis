# Attrition_Analysis

Our team select the topic Attrition Analysis as the project of the course MADS591/592 - MileStone1. We are going to explore the correlations between diverse variables and the attrition of employees.

## Data Source

The primary dataset is from Shared publicly in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset), which is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists 4 years ago. Assuming the data was randomly extracted from IBM annual human resources data with desensitization treatment. The second dataset is [Stack Overflow 2018 Developer Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/stack-overflow-2018-developer-survey) data published on Kaggle 3 years ago. It provides extra features to support our exploration and analysis.
